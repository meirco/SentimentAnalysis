Critic,4,80,FALSE,91,Entertainment Weekly,Wonder Woman is smart, slick, and satisfying in all of the ways superhero films ought to be.

Critic,5,100,FALSE,91,IndieWire,Wonder Woman is as much about a superhero rising as it is about a world deserving of her, and Dianas hard-won insistence on battling for humanity (no matter how frequently they disappoint) adds the kind of gravitas and emotion that establishes it as the very best film the DCEU has made yet.

Critic,5,100,FALSE,88,USA Today,A genuinely surprising film that plays with genre and throws out the now very tired superhero movie formula.

Critic,3,60,FALSE,83,MTV News,At times, Wonder Woman feels like watching Splash with a shield — another babelicious naïf breaking all the rules. Yet the joke isn't on her.

Critic,5,100,FALSE,80,The New York Times,Its earnest insouciance recalls the “Superman” movies of the ’70s and ’80s more than the mock-Wagnerian spectacles of our own day, and like those predigital Man of Steel adventures, it gestures knowingly but reverently back to the jaunty, truth-and-justice spirit of an even older Hollywood tradition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Critic,1,20,TRUE,60,New York Magazine (Vulture),The only grace note in the generally clunky Wonder Woman is its star, the five-foot-ten-inch Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot, who is somehow the perfect blend of superbabe-in-the-woods innocence and mouthiness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The good side of theThis was the first super-hero movie since 2008's The Dark Knight, that I ever wanted to give a go and watch it on the big screen. The result: What I expected, I have to say beforehand that I wasn't expecting much really. The good side of the coin in this one are the outfits and probably the setting. It's great to see that they finally decided to make a female super-hero movie, but unfortunately it fell short not as a super-hero movie but just a movie. On the other hand, on the bad side there are several flops like the lack of charisma in the characters and also the goofiness and sometimes overacting of Gadot. In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend to spend your time and money on this one, you would probably be bored by the first half, or either overwhelmed by its abusive use of slow-mo effects!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
User,4,8,TRUE,0,BabeRuthless38,This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.                                                                                               A few comments:- Most reviewers overlook the most obvious thing about the fight on the beach: there was nothing villainous about the Germans (who were just chasing a spy), so when the amazons ruthlessly attack them without provocation and slaughter them to the last man, it arguably sets a much darker tone than anything we've seen yet in the DCEU. Contra their self-rhetoric, the amazons seem to revel in warfare and killing and make sport of it (after all, their whole raison d'etre is to hunt down Ares and kill him); note that unlike Batman and Superman  (who fight with grim determination when the situation demands it) Diana actually smirks cheerfully as she slices terrified German infantrymen to mincemeat, even though they're just anonymous people fighting for their country. This was a very shrewd," very dark take on ""empowerment"" as an excuse for celebrating morally gruesome behavior.- Despite Gadot's indifferent performance (she apparently went to the same acting school as Daisy Ridley: ""Open your eyes wider! Scrunch your brow up! Good"," now pout! pout!"")", the character of Diana likewise undermines well-worn superhero tropes. She is notable for her feminine passivity and receptivity; powerful she may be, but nothing she does is self-willed. She merely fulfills missions and directives handed down from Hippolyta and Steve," without knowing or caring about the larger picture (what middlebrow critics are calling ""innocence"" and ""moxie"" is really blithe naivete and ignorance). The one thing she does do impulsively is to leap up and gratuitously slaughter some Germans when the opportunity arises", but like I said, the amazons clearly love killing. Her lack of serious inner struggles or flaws to overcome throws her in sharp relief against the other superheroes on offer these days.- Other tropes are undermined. There is almost no cliche more overworked these days than the Hollywood-diverse squad of sidekicks, but the striking thing here is that they're portrayed with wicked wit as mostly-useless caricatures: the grumbling Indian helps by providing SMOKE SIGNALS, the Muslim poses as a bumbling servant, and the Scotsman just babbles and gets in the way. The fact that the writers slip this by without being called out on these problematic blackface performances shows the true subtlety of imagination that went into the script.- Similarly, Diana's mission ultimately fails. Yes, she kills Ares, but so what? It doesn't end the war, it doesn't prevent the next (far worse) war," it really doesn't do anything. This leads to the savagely cynical ending where Diana asserts that ""only love can save the world"" while retiring from heroine work to a life of obscurity (note how when she reappears in BvS no one has ever heard of her). Meanwhile Steve Trevor actually saves the day by destroying the poison gas (a threat Diana repeatedly made clear she didn't care about)", making the ultimate heroic sacrifice to actually save lives and change the outcome of the war.- In Man of Steel Clark overcame humanity's mistrust of his alien nature by proving his willingness to abandon loyalty to Krypton and fully assimilate to American society; the movie ends on a hopeful note that he'll be able to use his power to guide humanity toward a brighter future. Wonder Woman ends with Diana more alone and alienated than ever, withdrawing from the world having failed to save anyone or change anything. Again, this is the kind of brilliant subversion that Suicide Squad was supposed to have.- Danny Huston looms hilariously over the movie as a caricature of a generic, scenery-chewing face of evil. I definitely think the filmmakes made some bold choices," but they are far from making ""warfare itself"" the villain as some have proposed; if anything they provide a postmodern critique of that approach by showing how trench warfare -- so horrifying to the men who fought it -- is basically a fun game (and chance to show off) to the indestructible Diana. Huston's deliberately underwhelming and absurd fight with Diana is a blackly comic take on the bloated 3rd act showdown these movies always feel obligated to provide (this is then FURTHER lampshaded by actually giving us a bloated 3rd act showdown"," against a literal mustache-twirling Dark Apparition From Nowhere with less gravity than a Final Fantasy villain). - Lastly it was amusing how the Germans were so Nazified despite this being WW1. This itself comments on the absurdity of the whole concept of putting a superheroine (especially a cheesecake lingerie-model superheroine in a padded leather corset) in the middle of a horrific meat grinder historical event like WW1. The point is that the studio is saying ""WW1", WW2, Nazis or not Nazis," what's the difference? You think the proles in Dayton (and Beijing) will care? They're Krauts! They deserve to die!"". This is black humor at its finest", and makes a trenchant jab at the similar dehumanization of the Other seen in movies like Saving Private Ryan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Painfully bad entry into a painfully bad DC universe. Origin story of Diana ,who doesn't know who she really is,raised by Amazons who have no clue what's outside their little invisible island area.The first hour and a half are incredibly tedious as Diana is at first shielded from harm by her mother not letting her be trained but then ends up being trained to be the 'best there is' .She then saves Steve and goes off into the war with a rag tag group of character actors to find and slay Aries the god of war and end the second world war.The direction is pretty bad in this film as there are lots of inconsistencies in Diana's character.At first she's never seen a man before but a day later she's talking about having read sex manuals.At first she is a confused girl who doesn't fight when the Germans attack Themiscura and a day later she's a cross between Captain America and the Incredible Hulk.They do the 'fish out of water' thing for awhile when she first hits western society which is awkward  and more awkwardness when they mingle sexual tension in as they go along with Steve.It is done very clumsily and rivals Amadala's romance with Anikin Skywalker in Star Wars for cringeworthiness. She has a shield and 'the sword that is the only thing that can kill Aries' but thinks nothing of just handing them to a frumpy government secretary to wander off with.Some warrior.Occasionally during this they go off and we see a bad general and his evil scientist henchwoman who have developed poison gas to kill everyone .Oh and they had to bring the plight of the North American native into it as well which was kind of out of place to say the least.I don't think i'll be watching any more DC films unless they can get Joss Whedon to direct.Gadot still isn't a very good actor to play WW in my opinion as she isn't strong looking enough and hasn't got the acting gravitas to pull it off.When they put her in a suit and hat to disguise she just shrinks out of sight and she and steve do a bit of an I Love Lucy type skit thing in a room with the allied generals.The action isn't all that great either .See this film at your own peril. Dunno how it gets so many good reviews. I couldn't wait to get out of the theatre personally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However all that is really here is a mediocre film trying to pander to so many demographics such as millenials and feminists that it does not grasp exactly who it is offending and just hopes to snag those demos support to carry into being received far better than it actually is.When you whittle away the marketing all you are left with is downright boring.

Really?- Could they not even get an American actress to play an American icon like Wonder Woman? The Israeli accent was a constant distraction- Gal Gadot is cute", but as BvS proved she's not much of an actress. This is a woman who until just recently was best known for a throwaway eye candy role in Fast & Furious movies.- The action scenes (super strong woman with shield fighting old timey soldiers) were very derivative of the original Captain America movie. With the superhero market so overstuffed these days it'd be nice to have some original visuals and action, but no dice.- Chris Pine is totally unconvincing as a ladies' man. He's a decent actor but it's pretty clear (as it was in Star Trek) that he doesn't actually swing that way in reality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All these years nothing has happened, but one day a fighter pilot crash on the cost of their island. Then the princess embark a journey back with him to find, and end the Ares threat forever. But she only ends up in the WWII, and what happens in the following sequence are the rest of the film.Who would have done a better job than Patty Jenkins. She nailed it, and so set to direct the sequel too. Even the supporting cast was good. DC's visuals always high standards and so this one. Action sequences too amazing. There's lots of changes in the character, as well as in everything. Firstly a nice superhero costume. And connections like Diana's father, the island, all pretty nicely written out.

Not to say that the movie is bad, far from it. It is indeed a massive improvement over the lackluster Batman vs Superman and the disaster that was Suicide Squad. However, there was just something missing in Wonder Woman that left me feeling a little disappointed. Which is a shame, because this movie had a great foundation. Wonder Woman in World War I, trying to end the war to end all wars. And overall, I did like the characters, I like Diana's and Steve's relationship, I liked the perspective Diana had about the human world. How she had to learn and grow, as anyone would have to.Unfortunately, after a very long two hours, the climax came, and everything the film did right was undone. In a final battle, filled with mediocre CGI, an overly silly villain, and lame action. It didn't help that Gal Gadot's lack of acting experience was massively exposed, especially when paired with seasoned actors like Robin Wright.Believe me, the movie is good. DC is not dead yet.

Not to mention her ""resolve"" at the end is a bit unfounded considering she was right about Ares.

It also changed the present day from WW2 to WW1.  The latter choice was probably due to the first Captain America being set in WW2.  The ""Great War"" setting plays though.

I went to see the movie with all the 90%ish reviews and oh boy," was I disappointed.Gal Gadot plays an ok Wonder Woman and she probably is one of the brighter spots of the movie.The history is during WWI but it pretty much looks like WWII. The bad general could be substituted by a standard-cliche-WWII-Nazi-badguy and the evil female henchman is a WWI Dr.Mengele clone. Some of the outfits also are more WWII than WWI but those are details. The Germans are bad. The British are good.Despite its flaws the movie could be a solid 6 if not for the final 20-30 mins when it all goes to poop. Once the evil general (who is believe to be Ares by Wonder Woman) is slain there were two choices the creators could do. 1) Diana realizes that good and evil have nothing to do with Ares. That people are just a mixed bag. Steve could then convince her that the good ones are still worth fighting for. You get some deeper morality involved.2) Make a plot twist when it turns out Ares has a mustache and make 20-30 min of cliches with cheesy dialog along with MASSIVE BLOWING STUFF UP WITH BAD CGI and creating loop holes in the meantime.Now we all know which one they chose.The Good:Gal GadotChris PineThe Amazon IslandThis is meh combination of Thor with Captain America.

Also let's not forget that Hitler was actually a soldier in the German army in WW1 so you do wonder if this was intentional - as a metaphor - for a jewish person to kill him in WW1 !Ares is killed in the end by this woman & jewish actress - metaphor for Hitler?There are only 3 reasons why anyone would rate this beyond 5: either you are a woman, you are a kid or you are paid.

The movie gets at least a 10-point deduction right there, which may explain why not one metacritic review gave it 100. Another knock on the director goes to the realism of some of the battle scenes. I never felt like I was looking at anything other than a set during the scenes in the Belgian town, for example. The budget should have been big enough to conjure up a bit more Saving Private Ryan. That’s another 10 points. Now that we’ve put things into better context, let’s say that Gal Gadot is a great choice, and I look forward to a nation (world) of girls wanting to grow up to be like her. Physically imposing, sincerely expressive, and capable of byplay with Chris Pine—well done, box checked for our lithe super heroine. The special effects were more distracting than dramatic, but this only had a meaningful negative impact on the obligatorily apocalyptic finale. I left the theater somewhat disappointed, but they’ll get another chance to tighten it up in the next go-round.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS DRAMATICALLY: Many other reviewers have already eloquently expressed the issues with this movie. Perhaps the problem was that the movie had too much responsibility resting on Gal Gadot's shoulders. The idea that finally, having a female superhero could somehow save the DC universe's Justice League curse.Sadly, the same **** three act piece of **** script was played out here. It's overly long, overly sentimental, and just gushing with sentiments about love. A literal goddess falls in love with humanity - the playthings of her father.There are nice moments in the first two acts, but the entire German WW1 plot is laughable - maybe so much so that it will eventually be funny. Much much too long, did not pass the 'need to pee' test. You can't have a drink in this overly long movie... the end fight scene alone will feel like a literal millennia and you will be as lonely and sad as Diana herself in your desperate need to pee and your firm belief it has to be over soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had high hopes for this movie. The trailers were very good (although all of the DCEU's trailer were good), Gal Gadot, one of the best things about Batman v Superman, was Wonder Woman, and it was getting good reviews from critics! I mean, it had all the ingredients to make a wonderful super salad. However, when I walked out I was shocked at how wrong I was. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the movie was good. Particularly towards the beginning where she is with Chris Pine (Hearthrob, and Captain in the Star Trek movies) on their way to London. Some character setting, fight sequences, some funny moments later," we get to the part of the movie where it drags down. SHe finds the ""Bad guy""", only to (spoiler alert) find out its not the bad guy, which you would guess halfway through the movie. Then, oh God," then the awful emalgamation know as the ""ending"" to this movie begins. The CGI", throughout the movie, was spotty at best, but here it is just... it looks like it could've come from a 2008 movie. And also the villain reveal was just stupid, out of all the potential people it could've been, it was THAT GUY? So the ending aside, there is one more sin this movie committed. THE MUSIC. Man, was it just generic and boring, overdramatic as well. You literally could've grabbed this music, and place it on any, and I mean ANY, Marvel movie. Also, I feel as though they could've chosen a better war, like World War 2, to set it in. There was a clear definition of who was good and who was bad in this movie, and in World War 1, there truly was no good or bad guys. It was just a bunch of people fighting each other for no good reason other than a guy, a guy who no one really liked in the first place, being assassinated. But, that is just a matter of opinion, and as such, it will not affect this review significantly. In conclusion, this movie was pretty good at first, and had a lot going for it, but then the end, just absolutely destroyed the movie for me, as well as the orchestra. Oh, and can you spell cliche? If you want to see a good movie, I'd wait for some other superhero movies," or maybe see that new horror movie ""It Comes at Night.""

Her reactions to our early modern world were pretty cute and funny. Chris Pine is perfectly cast(turns out ""casted is not right) and doesn't feel like a re-tread of Kirk. Those two make for a great definition of actor chemistry(Even if super cute Carey Mulligan doesn't believe in that) Take the infectious comedy of the first half and the tower-smashing action scene and this is a really good satisfying movie. But the final battle doesn't come close to the unbelievably amazing Doomsday fight of Batman and Superman. Ares's old British persona doesn't work for me as an adversary. And when he carves out the openings of his helmet in a disconcertingly generic fantasy armor"," it's done out of reverence(I was going to say ""preference"")to his old Zeus battling days rather than out of necessity. Plus floating in the air with telekinetic powers doesn't add up to rough and emotional combat. This", along with it's flurries to a triumphant and pg-13 seen-it-a-million-times tone,comedy dragging the tension down, and stupidly elbow-leaning(that's what I did when I was let down; you know, leaning your elbow on the cup holder, fist to cheek? I was gonna say cringe-inducing but that's regulated to any broadcasted, video game focused event i.e.game awards) Greek mythological back-story do a effective job of dragging the movie down. This all seems very Marvel inspired and I'd be curious as to how the re-shuffling of Warner bro's DC executives might've added to this, but it is likely those parts were already in place before the awful reception of Bat&Sup. While I do feel positive about a good deal of this movie, it's shortcomings leave me with a bad taste in my mouth(unlike that vanilla ice cream) and drag down down my regards for the DC movie universe. But hopefully not enough to stop me from enjoying my 3rd re-watch of the standout title.Lets hope Wonder Woman's different way of doing things doesn't continue with Justice League. But maybe I should've seen this coming. After all, this wasn't directed by Zack  Snyder, managing only the role as producer and story writer(apparently their's a difference between being a writer and doing the story). This makes me feel a little bit better about the state of Justice League.

It's colorful and has a great message for empowerment for both women & men. Without the painfully obvious re-shoots and no Kanye West songs or Queen Bohemian Rhapsody thrown in for ""improvements"". The movie is at least watchable and enjoyable. And get this", it's got a sense of humor, even when some of it didn't hit the mark.While I liked the movie overall, however I didn't quite love it like everyone else. My issues are with the first act being sluggish and filled with cliche digoule. Soon as Chris Pine shows up is when it picked up for me," as you get some great scenes between Steve and Diana.The film had a great message about war and how everyone is a mix of good and bad; which sadly gets ruined in the third act and turns into ""Man of Steel"" climax all over again. Pretty disappointing. And I didn't like Wonder Woman theme (which is rock music) playing while the story is set in WW1. It just felt odd and out of place hearing rock music during that type of era", but that's my opinion.I don't know who does the visual effects for the DC movies, because it doesn't look that good and very unfinished. I mean, some of it looked decent when it's not against real life environment, although that can't be said for the rest.The movie also suffers from the same problem with Marvel and that's the villains. Talk about cartoonist at it's worse and just stereotypical. Just be glad it isn't as bad as enchantress.Overall rating: Wow, it may look like I named off more problems than positives.

User,5,10,TRUE,5,saintdecky,Wonder Woman, though not a perfect movie in many ways, is still better than the preceding DCEU movies. The movie was fun in some scenes, boring and repetitive in others, and some were average and progressed the plot like it had to.Acting:Wonder Woman, though not a perfect movie in many ways, is still better than the preceding DCEU movies. The movie was fun in some scenes, boring and repetitive in others, and some were average and progressed the plot like it had to.Acting: Gal Gadot is a great fit for Wonder Woman, and has a good range of emotions. Chris Pine was also good and pretty charming throughout. Chris Pine and Gal Gadot had great chemistry together, and exchanged nice, charming dialogue and sometimes even meaningful conversations about mankind and war. Every other actor and actress do what they have to, but aren't anything special.Characters: The only people with the most characters throughout are Gadot and Pine. They spent good time developing a bond between them, and didn't force a love connection, which I thought worked out perfectly fine. However, many other characters fall flat. I didn't care for Diana's mother or her sister that much, and even got them confused constantly. They were just characters that existed to move the plot forward and weren't necessarily good or bad. Just, characters that exist. The three guys that tag along with Gadot and Pine have virtually no characters, and I don't even recall any of them actually killing anyone. They are one of the most extreme examples of supporting characters I have ever seen. They exchange some lines and have a hint of a backstory here and there, and can be a tad charming at times, but really only existed so the plot could utilize them to benefit Wonder Woman or Chris Pine. The villains are okay and have their motives, but in the end, are still superhero villains, who usually end up being forgettable or nothing special. In this case, they are forgettable, as I will probably forget the villains by the end of this year.Plot: Of the three acts in the movie (Diana growing up and leaving the island with Pine and strolling through London, the crew fighting their way through the war to get to the Germans, and the final fight scenes and conclusion), the second act was the best. The first act didn't necessarily do anything wrong; they introduced Diana, had the basic exposition scene, had the aunt/trainer get shot and try to tell Diana something before she dramatically dies, and she leaves the island. It did everything it had to do, and wasn't necessarily boring, but just struck me as pretty basic storytelling. The third act was probably the worst for me. The twist was introduced and was okay, but then the final fight between Wonder Woman and Ares was boring and repetitive and done badly. They punch back and forth and fly through the air and throw big objects at each other, kind of like Man of Steel. It goes on for what seems like forever, and though the effects are good, feels boring and like it doesn't progress. Just the same thing over and over. The second act was the best for me because it had the best action. There were some good fight scenes that would've made the movie much better if there were more of them. It also introduced a good look at war and mankind. Since this is Diana's first time experiencing war," it is a fresh take on the horrors of warfare from the perspective of someone who is seeing it for the first time. She says stuff like ""why are they fighting?"" or ""this is horrible."" It is a good reminder that war is hell and it adds to the sinister tone of war because it is from the perspective of someone who is just now seeing it. Imagine you lived in peace for your whole life", learning to fight but never actually having to use it. Then, you jump into a world where men are shooting each other's heads off, you would most likely be disgusted or confused about why they do it. The movie did a good job of putting us behind Diana's eyes and feeling what she feels when she sees a whole village of innocents get wiped out. This made the second act the best part of the whole movie, and where most of the 5 rating comes from.Script: The script is nothing special except for the scenes where Diana and Pine share deep insights and dialogue about the behaviors of man. It is charming at times, but otherwise is nothing special.Zack Snyder stuff: Though Snyder only produced the movie, he still slapped his signatures all over it. The signature dark, gritty, dirty color scheme is very apparent in this movie. Dark tones and imagery can, of course, be used very well. I always felt Snyder overuses this dark tone that doesn't always work with some superhero movies. However I did like the choice of making the island very bright and happy, and then, when entering the cruel world of war, is plunged into a darker color palette. Although it still feels over-the-top at times.Wonder Woman is an okay superhero movie with good leading characters, an otherwise forgettable cast, good action scenes, but fails to entertain through most of the movie. It was a bit predictable, but it mainly gets a low rating because of the whole last act, which I thought was done very poorly.

User,5,10,TRUE,6,Spangle,Calling this the best film released as part of the DC Extended Universe thus far is a rather easy task, but does Wonder Woman rise to the level of being a good film? Well, probably not. It is not bad (BVS) or one of the worst things thatCalling this the best film released as part of the DC Extended Universe thus far is a rather easy task, but does Wonder Woman rise to the level of being a good film? Well, probably not. It is not bad (BVS) or one of the worst things that could ever be imagined (Suicide Squad)," but Wonder Woman is still not some kind of a good movie. It is close though and decidedly ""above average"" as Chris Pine's Steve Trevor so neatly offers to describe both his looks and the film's quality. So what is the god killer in Patty Jenkins' first foray into the world of Wonder Woman? After firing and missing on its two most recent efforts", the DCEU lightened things up, but avoided the true cause of death: cliches. There is hardly anything original about the villain or other plot happenings and the film is crushed under this predictable weight. It is a beautiful looking film nonetheless," but it remains a rather pale and typical superhero film blended with a female empowerment picture.It is in the latter that the film is perhaps the most muddled. As Diana/Wonder Woman's (Gal Gadot) encounters with the outside world begin in a ""fish out of water"" type fashion (featuring the requisite jokes to highlight how out of touch she is)", she is treated very woman-like. Steve tries to save her from any danger and brings her to buy clothes. It is eerily reminiscent of Mila Kunis in Jupiter Ascending who, though she is known as the one who can save the world, spends 60% of the film cleaning toilets. Here, Diana is spared the scrubbing of an inner bowl, but is nonetheless forced into a womanly hole of having to wear flashy dresses and to act like a woman. Naturally, this all comes after Steve has seen her kick ass while in the Amazonian world. No matter, eventually the men will come around, correct? Wrong. Instead, every man that surrounds her consistently tries to hold her back, hold her hand and lead her around, or shield her with their bodies. With comments about how attractive she is and jokes about how attractive she and her friends are, the film further makes one wonder if this is really a female empowerment picture. Yes, women kick ass in Wonder Woman," but they are never treated as the equals of men. Even the dialogue uttered by Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) about the world describes it as the ""world of men"". The line about how men are useless besides procreation is a bit too much in the opposite direction (more about emasculation of men than it is empowerment of women). All in all", the film gives her room to take people down," but she is never given credit for her actions in a way that does not sound like ""pretty good for a woman"". Compared to Gamora or Black Widow", Wonder Woman is never able to not be a woman. Instead, every line and action by those around her serves as a reminder that, yes, she is a woman.If the dialogue did not remind you, perhaps the camera work will. As Laura Mulvey so perfectly defined, this film is very much the product of internalized sexism. With camera work that focuses on Gal Gadot's ass and with the camera working its way up from the bottom to allow the scopophilic audience to soak in every inch of our superhero. For a film with marketing so focused on showing her to be a beacon of female strength, it seems rather fine with having her represent to-be-lookedatness and the result of the male gaze by the camera and the audience. Yes, the film tosses in Chris Pine naked once, but for a film about a woman and for women, it seemed more interested in objectifying Diana than Steve. In a similar vein, the scantily clad costume design is both problematic and not. For one, it is too much and only allows the camera to soak in more skin. On the other, Steve tries to get her to change because she is so scantily clad, which is equally problematic. If she is comfortable, why change? She should be wearing more clothes because, if it is armor, why must she wear a skimpy skirt and not full body armor like male superheroes and warriors? But, forcing her to change to be appropriate is like the film recognizing it is absurd, but also taking away her own autonomy when it comes to deciding what she can and cannot wear, giving control of that to her male love interest.The film's stereotypical approach to women may be crushingly disappointing based upon expectations, but what is perhaps worse is how awful the villain winds up being. Turns of Ares is just a pissed of British guy who wants to destroy the world like every other villain in a superhero movie. Given no development beyond a desire to kill the world and having killed Zeus and other gods to follow through on this, the chief villain here is rather dull and, worse," is killed by the power of love. Gaining superpowers from grief and love in a scene that plays out like the ""Save Martha"" one from Batman v Superman", Diana is finally able to overcome him by, as she later describes herself, by discovering that love conquers all.,,,,,

Wonder Woman hits all the right beats, it's got good action and a lot of heart. Unlike Superman, she's actually vulnerable to bullets, which gives the film more tension. Gadot is a bit one-note, but that works for most of the film, and her relationship with Chris Pine is endearing and feels natural. There are a few moments when the film flirts with being something more, but the finale doesn't quite live up and ends up being more standard fare. It seems a bit weird to defeat the God of War by out-fighting him, rather than out-thinking him. You'd think Ares would be unstoppable in a fight, and the film seems ready to end with Ares seeing the good in humanity, but then he just kind of growls and keeps fighting. Seems like a lost opportunity. And it's a bit dissonant to see Wonder Woman bemoaning war while she slaughters her way through dozens of soldiers, clearly killing them instead of disarming or incapacitating them. There are a number of smaller issues as well, the film sets up quite a few side-plots that never really develop at all. We're introduced to a number of quirky side characters, but their quirks never amount to anything. The CG was also quite poor: you've got a $150 million budget and yet the lasso of truth looks laughably bad, and why does she need to be in front of green screen for the trench shot, which is basically just a muddy field with some smoke in the background.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The history of the character and the movie plot itself. The first part tells the story well and progresses in a natural tempo. However the second part does not quite match up where the firs part left off. Story line feels a bit forced. All in all it was an enjoyable movie. Actors - 7/10Great cast with good charaters. No one seems out of place.Gal Gadot - Wonderwoman 7/10Have to talk about the main charater for herself. Gal is so stunning she captivates you in every scene. The fights are well performed and she does a great job. Her presence is felt.As we all know Gal is not an American and english is not her first language. All though her english is fine and you can easily understand her, the pronunciation can at times make the dialog feel scripted and not a natural progression of a conversation. This is something I think she will get better at overtime but as far as grading her performance i believe it is the only thing draging down the grade somewhat because she performed everything else beautifully.  Cinematic - 8/10Beautiful shot with high depth. Great colorization to bring in the right mood and the action scenes is filmed at a pace where the action is seen and now flown by in an instance.Overall: 6 / 10Stunning actress, good cast, beautiful cinematics but somewhat inadequate story line drags the grade down. The movie is enjoyable and worth watching.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would have been better if the movie ended with Wonder Woman killing that evil German dude, and Chris Pine's character's speech to her after that. Maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the comic, but what really happens after Ares is killed? There's still the Pacific theater fighting. Is there another Ares that Wonder woman needs to kill?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't if I should make a big deal about or be apathetic for **** this like makes no sense - It is not indictment of women that the movies they directed didn't earn such moolah ever before. But perhaps, highlighting such may affect the industry in a better way hopefully.This is a movie that for me stood because of Gal Gadot taking the titular role and it her own in terms of sheer glamour, grace, beauty and strength she portrayed. Rarely before have I been convinced of strong superwoman  portrayal. Also Chris Pine and his gang of burly front-liners are much more poignant in men at war storyline, despite how hackneyed and bad the World War background was shown; not that much is expected of superhero movies in that regard anyway.The thing that makes this movie was worth the watch is it values the meaning of sacrifice and the impact of human lives; despite all their darkness and malevolence, the important choice to be made of what, who and why you want to believe in. That's what Wonder Woman is about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

User,5,10,FALSE,9,WorldofLucky,This is one of the best movies this year so far, and the best DC movie ever.I knew Wonder Woman was going to be good. There was just too much good press, too many great reviews and too many of my friends that were gushing. I was ready to beThis is one of the best movies this year so far, and the best DC movie ever.I knew Wonder Woman was going to be good. There was just too much good press, too many great reviews and too many of my friends that were gushing. I was ready to be disappointed because almost anything couldn't live up to that hype, but it did.Gal Gadot is a wonderful actress. She really came across as someone who was engaged in a childhood quest and learned the realities of life that make those quests never what they were supposed to be. She did action very well, just more proof that women and action movies should be together. She carried great humor, and just overall sold that role.I have a love-hate-hate relationship with DC. I did like all the Batman's, I liked the original superman (RIP Christopher Reeves), and I think Ben Affleck did really well as Batman in the most recent Batman V Superman. However lately the DC movies have just sucked, and sucked hard. I did have a bit of a fun time with Suicide Squad, but I did not enjoy Batman V Superman at all. In fact I was worried before the movie came out that Ms. Godot would have sucked. However, this movie has shown that Zack Snyder did her a disservice (and the fans as well) when he didn't focus on her more in that movie. She might have saved that movie.Oh, and I didn't mention Man of Steel, that is because both the movie and the actor are in the worst list of DC movies (which rank lower than other super hero movies, so it makes it pretty low).One more point, Patty Jenkins was an awesome director. I suspect most if not all of the reason this movie was greatThe good: Everything about this movie is good, the action, the acting, the director, all of it.The bad: The feeling I am going to have when I go back to the next DC movie that isn't Patty Jenkins or Gal Godot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Throughout the years of superhero genre, their male counterparts have been dominating the big screen and no movie studios wanted to do superheroines movie due to fear of underperformance such as 1984’s Supergirl and 2005’s Elektra. The fourth instalment in DC Extended Universe features another famous DC Comics’ iconic superheroine, Wonder Woman, in her very first solo movie as the lead character after her big screen debut in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.Sometimes after fighting alongside Batman and Superman in Metropolis and the latter’s death, Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gadot) returns back to her normal life in Paris, France where she works as antique curator. She receives a package from Wayne Enterprise and it turns out to be an old photograph of herself and her old allies during World War I which was stolen by Lex Luthor previously. Seeing the old photograph, she recalls her past about her early life and her activities during World War I.Diana was born and raised in a hidden and mystical island called Themyscira. When she grew up, she was trained as an Amazon warrior by her aunt, General Antiope, although her mother, Queen Hippolyta, was initially reluctant to have her train as warrior. One day, Diana rescued an American pilot named Steve Trevor (Pine), who crashed land on the island while escaping from the German Army. When they caught up to Steve, both him and Diana were joined by the Amazons to fight off the soldiers. Unfortunately, General Antiope was killed in battle.Steve was interrogated by Queen Hippolyta, which he revealed that the German Army led by General Erich Ludendorff (Huston) and his chief scientist, Dr. Isabel Maru, were developing a new biochemical weapons which will turn the tides of World War I. Steve had stolen Dr. Maru’s notebook containing information about the weapons and he must bring it to his superiors in London, England. Believed that the war was caused by the God of War, Ares, Diana joined Steve on his mission and to stop Ares for good.Since her debut in the second instalment of the franchise, I knew that Wonder Woman is going to be amazing and I even hope that she will do well in her solo movie. Not only she is able to break the curse of superheroine movies being a failure, she definitely can be as good as her male counterparts.The performance of Gal Gadot and Chris Pine is amazing. Their on-screen chemistry with each other is very natural and it worked out very well. It is a very good thing that she was not over-sexualised for the sake of fanservice. It would have ruined the quality of the movie. Patty Jenkins deserved to be praised for her direction of this movie and made superheroine movie worth to watch. I really cannot imagine what this movie would have been if this movie is directed by male directors.The storyline of the movie is good but the villains of this movie lacked character development. Nevertheless, this movie is still fun to watch and it is really worth your time. If you think superheroine movies are bad, this one will definitely will change your mind. Hopefully, this movie will inspire other movie studios to make superheroine movies in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
