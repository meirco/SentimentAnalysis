Critic,4,80,FALSE,88,Chicago Sun-Times,To be sure, we get a classic comic book movie storyline about a megalomaniacal madman intent on taking over the world, but there’s often a relatively light tone to the proceedings. This is a throwback piece of pure pop entertainment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,1,20,TRUE,80,The Observer (UK),While some sections of the globe-trotting plot strike a baggy, backward-looking note, it’s the smaller moments that make this fly, particularly when the film uses fantasy to turn horribly real everyday harassments into moments of air-punching triumph.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,1,20,TRUE,80,Arizona Republic,Wonder Woman 1984 director Patty Jenkins’ long-awaited sequel, is a much better film. It’s not that it’s lacking in chaos. (With a running time of 2 hours and 31 minutes, it's not lacking in much.) It just uses chaos more judiciously. That's fitting for a film about wretched excess, about getting what you want and realizing that maybe you were better off without it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,2,40,TRUE,80,BBC,Jenkins has said that she would have liked the film to be 15 minutes longer. Some viewers might have liked it to be 15 minutes shorter. But, for most of the running time, they will be happy to be in Wonder Woman's uplifting company. In its old-fashioned, uncynical way, WW84 is one of the most enjoyable blockbusters to be released since 1984.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,80,Total Film,We’ve all been waiting for Gadot, and it was worth it. A much-needed blockbuster full of humour, spectacle and optimism.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,80,Time Out,Sure, it gets a bit silly towards the end, and the promised post-credits scene is for the truly dedicated. But in a year when the cinemagoing experience could be categorised as ‘much too little’, you can’t really blame it for giving us a bit too much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,80,Los Angeles Times,Gadot and Pine give great pillow talk, and their easy screwball rhythms provide not just levity but ballast: They ground a movie in which time, for all its malleability, always feels like it’s slipping away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,5,100,FALSE,80,Empire,A vibrant and virtuous adventure packed with all the heart and heroism we’ve come to expect from DC’s shining light. Wonder Woman 1984 really is the hero 2020 needed all along.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,80,Screen Rant,Wonder Woman 1984 is filled with hope, love and optimism, offering impressively cinematic superhero action with beautifully sentimental heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Critic,5,100,FALSE,80,Slashfilm,If there ever was a role that played perfectly to Pascal’s natural charisma, it’s Maxwell Lord.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,1,20,TRUE,78,TheWrap,While the reteaming of Gal Gadot and director Patty Jenkins provides the expected thrills and excitement, this sequel shares the significant flaw of its predecessor: Both films graft an unwieldy and effects-heavy finale onto a movie that had managed to create relatable characters and situations, even when both are larger than life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,76,Paste Magazine,Wonder Woman 1984 has many of the same strengths and weaknesses as its predecessor. Fortunately, the exact mix and proportion of those strengths and weaknesses has shifted for the better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,5,100,FALSE,75,New York Post,The first film was set during the happiest time in human history: World War I. A tormented Wonder Woman took to the trenches and endured a solid hour of smoke and soot. Squint and you could maybe spot the main character.  Wonder Woman 1984, by contrast, is visually dazzling with kaleidoscopic color and buoyant action sequences. The plot, thank Ares, is no longer so self-serious, even if it is a bit knotty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,5,100,FALSE,75,The Atlantic,It’s a refreshingly silly and airy adventure focused on the emotions of one character, Wonder Woman (played by Gal Gadot), and a charming end to a tiring year of cinema.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,75,The Associated Press,The ambitions of Wonder Woman 1984 may be just outside its grasp, but it seldom feels predestined or predictable — a preciously rare commodity in the genre.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,75,The Globe and Mail (Toronto),The margins of the movie are so curious: there is an entire graduate thesis to be written about how a film starring a one-time Miss Israel features a subplot about Egypt magically erecting a giant wall within its borders, or how its 1980s aesthetics are inexplicably paired with modern moviemaking bloat. But the overriding keyword of Wonder Woman 1984 is “conventional.”...Which is fine, for now. Let’s watch these superpowered gods rumble amongst themselves. We can worry about our mortal world tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,75,USA Today,Wonder Woman 1984 is director/co-writer Patty Jenkins’ much lighter, somewhat campy follow up to her World War I-set 2017 hit film, though a lot has to do with the new retro time frame. While not quite up to par with its predecessor, the Reagan-era sequel returns Gal Gadot as the Amazon princess with the bulletproof bracelets, introduces a couple worthy foes, and is a pretty fun time even if the extremely busy “1984” almost wears out its welcome at a hefty two and a half hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,75,Polygon,The current DC movie universe is always dark, but it seems that with a movie drenched in the neon aesthetic of the ’80s, they’ve finally found a way to dim even Wonder Woman’s light.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,75,Entertainment Weekly,It takes some time to get to the major action set pieces (other than the prologue, which is gorgeous), but it’s too much of a pleasure to live in this well-realized place, populated by a quartet of capable and charismatic stars, to really care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,2,40,TRUE,75,IndieWire,Wonder Woman 1984 is all about playing with magic and wishes and desires, only to see them lead to horrible ramifications, instant gratification, and the revelation that lying is never without consequence. Those are some big swings, and not every single one lands, but the ones that do are both joyous and genuinely worth pondering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,70,Uproxx,Wonder Woman 1984 is pure sugar. There’s little nutritional value. But we all deserve dessert right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,67,Consequence of Sound,The messy plot will lose some, and others will find its over-saccharine emotions a reach, but to paraphrase Steve’s description of flight: If you can catch the movie’s uplifting wind, it will transcend the sum of its parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,65,Film Threat,Wonder Woman is not a horrible film and gets a very mediocre good from me. I liked it for what it is, but the expectation of something bigger and better was not met, and honestly, what I prefer in big-budget movies. I think this will be the general reaction to the film, and this is probably why, especially if you were expecting something as spectacular as the first Wonder Woman.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,63,ReelViews,Wonder Woman 1984 is overlong, tonally inconsistent, and poorly paced. Although it raises the bar during its final hour, the viewer has to navigate about 90 minutes of action-deficient, sometimes nonsensical narrative to get to the point where the title character (again played to perfection by Gal Gadot) does something other than moon over her lost love, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,63,Washington Post,For the first hour and a half, WW84 is a delightful flight of escapist fancy, with Diana and Steve's love story ensconcing itself comfortably, if a bit talkily, within the confines of an action adventure. Then, at the 90 minute mark, it’s as if Jenkins remembers her other deliverables, in the form of special effects, epic global crises and a plotty, ever-more-muddled story line that metastasizes into something much darker and more violent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,63,Observer,Is Wonder Woman 1984 entertaining? Sure, it’s fun, hits all the right superhero marks, and visually, the 1980-something world is a technicolor throwback to behold. But if our heroine is supposed to represent the good and hope for all humanity, one has to wonder who specifically this humanity is reserved for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,5,100,TRUE,63,The Seattle Times,Wonder Woman 1984 feels a bit perfunctory; just another massive superhero movie, with little fresh brought to the mix.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,63,Slant Magazine,The film shows a preference for forgiveness over vengeance, which feels like an okay way to end this particular year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,63,Chicago Tribune,It’s a moderately diverting sequel. That means it’s also a distinct drop down from the 2017 origin story.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,5,100,TRUE,60,CineVue,WW84 is far from perfect: its length and fumbling of Minerva’s arc are chief among its sins, but equally there are no denying its simple, vibrant charms. Much like Christopher Reeves as Superman, Gal Gadot simply is Wonder Woman – and this latest entry is undoubtedly her most fun, spectacular and charming yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,1,20,TRUE,60,ABC,You'd have to be a real Grinch to hate on a blockbuster sequelthat's so puppy-eager to please. But despite the fem power of star Gal Gadot and director Patty Jenkins, all the CGI huffing and puffing over 2 1/2 hours can deflate momentum and audience endurance..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,60,The Irish Times,The longer it goes on, however, the less fun and more earnest it becomes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,60,Rolling Stone,Courtesy of the stars, and of the filmmaker’s clear affection for her subject, there’s a little more soul here than there had to be, thankfully. That’s not everything. It’s also not nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,2,40,FALSE,60,Time,As an amusement designed to take the world’s mind off its problems for a few hours, Wonder Woman 1984 is perfectly suitable. But it’s also OK to wish for less noise and more wonder, especially in a world that’s filled with the former and sorely in need of the latter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,60,Variety,For nearly two hours of its 151-minute runtime, Wonder Woman 1984 accomplishes what we look to Hollywood tentpoles to do: It whisks us away from our worries, erasing them with pure escapism.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,5,100,TRUE,60,Vanity Fair,In its best stretches—the first hour of the film, let’s say—WW84 sweetly revels in its old-school trappings, its hokey mystery, its goofy villain, its resourceful hero. The film is light on its feet, colorful and playful in a way not seen elsewhere in the DC Universe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,60,The Hollywood Reporter,There's still a lot to love. Gadot remains a charismatic presence who wields the lasso with authority, even tethering lightning bolts in some arresting moments. However, I missed the more hand-to-hand gladiatorial aspect of so many fight scenes in the first movie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,60,Vox,Large adult sad boys who want to take over the world and launch it into an apocalypse is something we’ve seen before (see: Loki in Avengers, Ultron in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Luther and Doomsday in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, Steppenwolf in Justice League). This formulaic story is something fit for the other guys. The more time spent on it, the less time WW1984 spends being wondrous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,1,20,TRUE,60,The Guardian,This is an epically long and epically brash film from director and co-writer Patty Jenkins, but Gadot has a queenly self-possession and she imposes her authority on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,60,The Telegraph,So if Wonder Woman 1984 is playing near you, should you pounce? If it even remotely appeals, I’d say absolutely – even though the film itself, a direct sequel to 2017’s Wonder Woman, is a bit of a marshmallowy muddle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,FALSE,58,The Film Stage,Once the story reaches its emotional crest, all the foundational work gets lost in the plot’s momentum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,5,100,TRUE,58,The A.V. Club,Wonder Woman 1984 is lively and bright and entertaining enough that it only occasionally feels like it’s going to go on forever. But it’s hard to get past what seems like a lack of consideration—or perhaps concern— for what motivates Diana Prince, or what fans like about her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,TRUE,50,RogerEbert.com,Gadot remains a winning and winsome figure in “Wonder Woman 1984,” and she retains her authentic connection with the audience, but the machinery around her has grown larger and unwieldy. Maybe that was inevitable, the urge in crafting a sequel to make everything wilder and brasher, more sprawling and complicated. In the process, though, the quality that made the original film such a delight has been squashed almost entirely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,50,San Francisco Chronicle,It’s a grand bogus mess passing itself off as a philosophical statement. It has its moments, but they’re few. Often, it’s a beautiful-looking film — but it’s beauty without substance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Critic,3,60,FALSE,50,Original-Cin,You want to escape? Well, there’s a couple of hundred million U.S. dollars up on the screen for action and special effects, and retro amusement provided by pastel-coloured shopping malls, big shoulder pads, and Sony Walkmans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,TRUE,50,CNN,While there are some visually striking action sequences as Diana and her new super-powered foe square off -- and Gadot remains extremely appealing in humanizing the character -- the last act devolves into a bit of a mess.,a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,1,20,FALSE,40,The New York Times,Patty Jenkins is behind the camera again, but this time without the confidence. Certainly some of the problems can be pinned on the uninterestingly janky script, a mess of goofy jokes, storytelling clichés and dubious politics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,40,ScreenCrush,Pretty much everything in Wonder Woman 1984 that’s not an excuse for a Gadot and Pine reunion flops. That includes both of its villains.,a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,3,60,FALSE,40,Wall Street Journal,The sensibility of the earlier production has been transformed, despite Ms. Gadot’s continuing authority. Wit has been replaced by feverish caricature, feeling by sentimentality, and Wonder Woman is left with almost nothing to do for long stretches of a very long and disjointed story.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,2,40,FALSE,40,Austin Chronicle,Jenkins had an opportunity to build on the flawed but rousing headlining debut of DC's greatest woman warrior. Instead, she delivered the modern DC Extended Universe's Superman III. It's a lumpen mass of half-ideas and glaring fan service, topped by a horrendous montage ending that is clearly designed to inspire hope, courage, and kindness, but will more likely make everyone wonder if that was why they waited two and a half hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,4,80,TRUE,38,LarsenOnFilm,When you hit a home run with Gadot, who was so thrilling in the 2017 film, you might want to make a sequel that keeps her at the center.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,1,20,FALSE,33,The Playlist,A movie that is fundamentally ill-conceived, poorly written, and missing most of the basic charms that made the original “Wonder Woman” such a delight (minus the last act). Directed again by Patty Jenkins, the film is also something of a nonsensical mess narratively, even by the most lenient and forgiving standards of superhero movies where fantastical, impossible things routinely occur. Suspension of disbelief is crucial to this genre, but ‘WW84’ is constantly breaking or conveniently upgrading its rules in ways that definitely break or at least always test your suspension of disbelief.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critic,1,20,FALSE,30,New York Magazine (Vulture),Sadly, all that glittered in the franchise’s first outing is gone in Wonder Woman 1984. The disappointing sequel highlights not only the dire state of the live-action superhero genre in film, but the dire state of Hollywood filmmaking as a whole.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The director really undid any credit from the first movie, and I am sure Warner is claiming this is all due to Covid-19 and counting on the bailout to hide this failure.  Given the 10s, the shills are out but nothing can cover-up how bad this is.  Hell, they had to keep Gal showing a lot of skin during the entire movie to keep any interest and distract attention from things like the lasso dissapearing from both her hands and suddenly being coiled on her him in 1/10th of a second, or being normally dressed to being in WW costume in same amount of time (after she hops out of the car mid movie).

However, the movie will break its own rules for the sake of progressing the movie, and since we all know everything will be fine since we have Justice League and Batman v Superman in a later timeline, the stakes in 84 don't matter.  The movie is to long and to conveluted to make you care since the outcome is already known.

I was sadly very disappointed to see that Warner Brothers and DC still haven't gotten the message and continue to squander beloved characters, great casts on poorly executed and poorly written scripts and storylines. Only redeeming qualities are some well choreographed fight scenes that felt reminiscent of the first film and some of the art direction for Cheetah and Wonder Woman key scenes. Gal Gadot is still the picture esque modern Wonder Woman with a heart of gold. Everything else feels poorly pieced together and leaves you confused and left wanting something better. Some moments were almost satirical and I found myself laughing at moments that were designed to create tension (children in a road). Pedro Pascal does well working with a character whose motivations and powers grow faster than character development. Warner Brothers continues their tradition of mediocre superhero movies in a post Avengers world. That said if you are a fan of the superhero genre and already have a HBO Max account watch it with lowered expectations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mall scene feels like a glorified Pepsi commercial. Character motivations make no sense and yet at the same time everything is extremely predictable. The action is fine, and even the acting is ok, but the story is outright terrible. Maybe it's due to the lack of big movie releases in 2020 that so many critics are enjoying this film... That's understandable. As a pure get-away mindless fun time, then this movie passes the test. If you were hoping for anything grander, then you may be disappointed.

While pining for her true love (Chris Pine), she comes to numerous rescues… on the DL. Two villains emerge: Max Lord, a greedy huckster who wants to rule the world (Pedro Pascal with verve but not special) and The Cheetah, a mousy researcher with a wish for super powers (Kristen Wiig who manages to subtly incorporate her comic charm). The evil-rules-the-world theme is tired and the evolution of the story is rather dumb. What we really care about is the action and there are some moments that thrill, but most of the scenes aren’t spectacular. To make matters worse, the attempts at emotional drama get in the way of a good time. After the engaging spirit and rousing stunts in the original, this follow-up doesn’t manage to instill the same magic or thrills. BTW, look for the real-life daughters of Gadot and Jenkins in a snowball toss near the end with Gadot’s hubby and other daughter riding a carousel in that sequence.

What I didn't like was the fact that they bring Steve back as a spirit that possesses some random guy's body, and that Diana and Steve, while possessing this man's body, are not only in this man's home, and trying on his clothes, but she has sex with this possessed man in his bed. If this wish stone made other people's wishes come true, and created giant walls and made other things materialize, then why didn't they just bring Steve back in his own body? Why did he have to take over this random man's life, who basically has no say in the matter? I'll bet you if the roles were reversed, and Batman or Superman wished for a dead lover to come back, and it possessed some random woman's body, and they had a scene with them waking up together in bed, that there would have been an uproar, because isn't that considered rape? Having sex with someone who's drunk or drugged, and not in control of their body or able to give consent, isn't that considered rape? And in the remainder of the movie this man, who is possessed by the spirit of Steve Trevor, is put into various perilous situations and even shot at and I don't think that's cool. Plus, I thought you only get one wish, so why did Barbara get two wishes? Her first wish to become like Diana, then the second wish to become an apex predator/Cheetah? That completely contradicts what we were told in the beginning of the movie. And why are all the men portrayed as catcalling jerks (i.e., except for Steve Trevor)? And why is there a little boy just roaming around unattended in various offices and facilities, and in the one of the last scene's he's stranded and walking alone on a stretch of highway, and at the end comes running out of the woods by himself? Where's his mother or guardian? Also, how does a man (Steve Trevor) who only flew planes in the 1940's able to fly a military jet that has 1980's technology? I think there are too many plot holes and things that make no sense, and that are just wrong and cringeworthy, especially the fact that a superhero has sex with a non-consenting possessed man. That's just wrong on so many levels and this movie is just wrong on so many levels.,,,,,

Lots of weird things happen and it all feels off kilter down to the script and reactions of characters, the film never seems to understand or follow the rules of its reality. The end just happens with no real resolute or cloture just an abrupt Christmas scene that just feels ham fisted.

I was checking my phone halfway through to help keep myself awake (we watched at night), which I don't normally do when watching movies. Super corny, campy, and sometimes even downright stupid. Seriously. Some of the special effects scenes are also very... old-timey (obviously fake) and weird. When using CGI, you should never call the audience's attention to the fact that green screens are being used... it's that bad. Movies using special effects should always try to make it realistic and believable. This one fails at it. Heavy on the messaging, which is nice enough in these tough times, but a little too heavy and lots of spoon-feeding.

It's like captain america if it was written by a 6-yerar old.  Wonder woman, for 40 years doesn't see anyone else. She just waits for a man.

I can't believe the same director and many of the same writers that made the first movie made this garbage.  I think this may be the single worst DC live action movie that has been made. The characters and the plot seem like they're taken directly from a teenagers fan fiction rather than from real Hollywood writers.Every character in this movie is a terrible human being except Chris Pine's character (kinda) and the son of the main villain.  Everyone.  Is Diana or another woman walking down the street?  Every single man they pass will start sexually harassing them.  I was a police officer for nearly a decade.  I know full well these types of guys exist and are more common than they should be.  They're still a small percentage of people though, and Hollywood's insistence on portraying all men as evil is just getting old.*****spoilers from here on*****The plot holes in the movie are hard to get past.  They're so obvious they completely ruin the movie.  Diana's powers are extremely inconsistent as well.  When she's fighting the convoy she has the strength to push a huge truck sideways at extremely high speeds down the highway.  Then a few minutes later while hanging off the side of a truck, Diana can't kick a truck to crush her over and just gives up, willing to be crushed to death.  Kicking that truck over should be 100x easier than what she JUST did, or she could at just flip up onto the top of the truck she's hanging from.  Diana's choice in this scene is just bizarre.  Later in the movie the main villain starts granting wishes to everyone.  These wishes are cursed and can be renounced.  Diana's plan is to broadcast to the world (magically I guess, since she JUST destroyed the camera equipment) is to appeal to everyone's humanity to renounce their wishes.  If this movie wasn't written by idiots, they would have had all wishes reversed when the main villain eventually reversed his.  But no, people kept renouncing after that.  What kind of naive writer thinks all those people are going to renounce their wishes?  No, human beings aren't nearly that altruistic.  Millions of people would think, that's for everyone else.  It wouldn't hurt if I kept mine.  I mean, Diana just physically fought her friend over this exact issue!  On top of this, the reversals are very inconsistent.  Some areas are still super trashed, while some areas are magically fixed.  Worse, some actions not even connected to wishes were reversed.Then there's the ending, where Diana meets the man she was willing to erase from existence so her boyfriend could live again.  What does she do?  She flirts with him!  What a psychopath! This doesn't even cover all of the plot holes I found, much less the ones I read about online after watching it.  I'm just tired of wasting any more of my time than I already have on this terrible movie.  I truly hope the writers put SOME effort into writing a decent script for the third movie.  What a disappointment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plot was incredibly muddled and honestly didn't make sense. That's usually okay in an action movie, but honestly there was hardly any action either.What we were left with was a 2.5 hour slog of lazy writing, poor character development, a glaringly inconsistent setting and an incredibly over-the-top and/or cheesy performance by a lot of the cast. It's a shame too because these cast members are usually quite excellent in other roles. Thanks to the lackluster visual effects, incredibly cringey writing and rather underwhelming directing, these top-grade talents seem more like they're performing dress rehearsals for a high school play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patty Jenkins and DC Comics should be embarrassed by this disaster. This was two and a half hours of my life I will never get back. I really liked the first Wonder Woman and went into this one with an open mind and positive attitude only to get an hour into the film and 'wishing' for it to be over. It is really that bad. If you are at least hoping for a cool 80's soundtrack to bring a little redemption to the film, you will disappointed there too. Not a single 80's song. This is absolutely the perfect film to put an exclamation point on 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I just wanna say I personally loved the first one. My favourite DC film by far. But this one is a total abomination to anything even remotely related to Wonder Woman. The characters are terribly written, Chris Pine is decent but is barely a part of it, there are only like 3 or 4 fight scenes in the film, and the villains are bad altogether, with Cheetah getting no satisfying conclusion and Max being an idiot Trump cosplayer. The film has zero pacing and by the 1 hour mark, you'll just wish it was over. I would not be surprised if this film oficcialy killed the DC film series. This movie makes Batman V Superman look like Shrek in quality comparison. (In that BVS was much better). Shame on you, Party Jenkins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

User,1,2,FALSE,1,Anandamoy,Infuriatingly stupid and dumb. For anyone who loved the 2017 movie," this would be nothing but a terrible disappointment. This movie should start with a disclaimer saying ""Please turn off your brains for the next 2 hours and 35 minutes or youInfuriatingly stupid and dumb. For anyone who loved the 2017 movie"," this would be nothing but a terrible disappointment. This movie should start with a disclaimer saying ""Please turn off your brains for the next 2 hours and 35 minutes or you might end up with an excruciating headache."" The script is totally inconsistent and literally nothing makes any sense. The very first scene itself is completely inconsistent with the premise set up in the prequel. I see a lot of reviewers regarding that scene as one of the best scenes of the movie", but clearly, they have forgotten or never watched the 2017 movie. As a child, Diana was not allowed to partake in martial sports with the other Amazonians and the Queen was especially against it. Here in this movie, we're forced to see the Queen proudly watching child Diana compete in the deadly warriorship olympics. Utterly distasteful and nonsensical.And then the actual movie begins, which really has nothing at all to do with that first scene. The plot is pointless, immature, and illogical. The characters lack dimension and conviction. Crucial details are just omitted or explained away with illogical dumb explanations. The motivations of the villains are completely unclear. For the climax, the threat seems to be of a nuclear war, but given the film's premise, such a war would not be in the interest of either Maxwell or Barbara. But they won't stop it. It's utter nonsense. BTW, the story of Barbara makes ZERO sense. At the end of the movie, you might just feel pity for her for the way she got treated in the movie. The ending sucks. No questions are answered - what happens to the stone finally - what happens to Barbara - nothing. There's just a random Christmas scene at the end that again, has nothing to with anything. It was July when they flew to Cairo. And now, it's Christmas. Deal with it!The entire plot of the wishing stone is just SO BEYOND DUMB. It's so unoriginal it hurts your brain if you think about it. The stone grants one wish," and so Maxwell wishes to be the stone itself so that he can himself have infinite wishes. Oh really!? I mean there was a skit in the FRIENDS show where Rachel mocks the guy who says ""if I had a wish I would wish for more wishes."" THAT WAS IN 1994. People were so tired of this cliche back in 1994 that comedy shows were writing jokes about it. And that's exactly what Patty Jenkins' big fat idea is for a 2020 movie supposed to be a blockbuster.The film is so immature. Devoid of depth", philosophy, or anything of substance. It grapples with a message that it doesn't understand. It makes abhorrent assumptions about the nature of humans that everyone," and yes LITERALLY EVERYONE on the planet is greedy and selfish and destructive. Throwing the whole ""there is good in humans"" message of the last film into the trash bin. The writing is ridiculously child-like and yet I can't think of a child who would actually find this movie interesting. There's no thrill", and the anti-climax is literally a drawn-out monologue!It's a disgrace. Honestly, everyone involved in making this film should be deeply ashamed of themselves for unleashing this garbage on the fandom. It's especially disgusting because it's supposed to follow up on the 2017 film, which as far as I am concerned, was a great movie. I loved it whole-heartedly and had big expectations for the sequel. This didn't just disappoint my expectations, it even went back in time to ruin the first film with that garbage opening scene. Seriously, shame on ya'll.I found the attempt to emphasize Wonder Woman's super-power of truth over her strength endearing, and the performances of Gal and Kristen are as good as they can be. The script isn't their fault, after all. So that amounts to the 1 star. Nothing else deserves any credit.Patty was clearly so obsessed with the 1978 Superman kinda films that she forgot it's 2020. WW84 wants to be Superman so hard that it even forces in a scene where WW is learning to fly just like Superman! Which is just as dumb and pointless as it can get. I mean, again - it's 2020!! People expect, NEED, movies with far more maturity now. Patty, please leave the writing to people who know how to do it.
